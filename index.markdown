#Welcome Fellow Lightning Newbies#

Like a lot of you, I recently started down the path of learning about Lightning Components. These are my notes based on a series of questions that I asked as I went through the docs and tutorials. This is not a cogent use case or app, these answers are simplest possible code snippets. Hopefully it's helpful. If you'd like a more complete use case, checkout Christophe's [Salesforce Lightning Tutorial](http://ccoenraets.github.io/salesforce-lightning-tutorial/).
