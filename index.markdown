#Salesforce Lightning Newbie Notes#

Like a lot of you, I recently started down the path of learning Lightning Components. These are my notes based on a series of questions I asked as I went through the docs and tutorials. This is not a cogent use case or app, insead these are simple code snippets illustrating the answers to my questions. 

Questions or comments? Find me on Twitter: [@ReidCarlberg](https://twitter.com/ReidCarlberg).

Something you'd like to add or change, or spellinig you'd like to correct? [lightning-newbie](https://github.com/ReidCarlberg/lightning-newbie) is on Github.
